	Our team introduces `Matter Tunnel', which enables the Matter protocol to
	operate on a blockchain basis. Matter is a protocol that provides interoperability
	between IoT devices from various manufacturers, allowing control of multiple
	brands of IoT devices from a single application. However, due to current
	network constraints such as NAT and firewalls, a dedicated Matter hub is required
	when using IoT devices. Matter Tunnel resolves the current limitations of
	Matter by utilizing blockchain technology, operating as if creating a virtual
	private network between applications and IoT devices. Primarily, it eliminates the mandatory use of Matter hubs, enhancing user experience and extending the operational range of IoT devices. This innovation also improves device functionality support, allowing them to support diverse and specialized device functionalities
	beyond Matter's predefined device types. From an enterprise
	perspective, all device interactions and transactions are permanently recorded
	on the blockchain, providing businesses with reliable and immutable data for
	tracking device usage patterns and extracting valuable operational insights.
	Furthermore, Matter Tunnel ensures platform independence, freeing users from
	being locked into specific ecosystems. It strengthens security by enabling
	complete end-to-end encryption (E2EE) and enhances user privacy. Additionally,
	by lowering entry barriers, Matter Tunnel opens up opportunities for small development
	teams to participate in the Matter ecosystem. With these improvements, users
	can enjoy a more secure, versatile, and unrestricted IoT experience.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to significant
growth in the smart home market. However, compatibility issues among IoT devices
from various manufacturers have been a persistent challenge. To address this
problem, the Matter protocol was developed, offering an approach that enables
control of IoT devices from multiple brands through a single application.

Despite the introduction of the Matter protocol, the current implementation still
harbors several crucial issues. These problems prevent the full realization of
Matter's original goals: true interoperability, security, and protection of user
privacy.

Therefore, we believe a new approach is necessary to overcome these
limitations and maximize the potential of the Matter protocol.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The current implementation of the Matter protocol presents the following key
issues.
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	\item Mandatory use of Matter hubs
	      	      	      
	      Network limitations such as NAT and firewalls make direct P2P
	      communication between IoT devices and applications challenging in typical
	      households. This necessitates the use of dedicated Matter hubs.
	      	      	      
	\item Limited Operational Range
	      	      	      
	      As a consequence of the mandatory use of Matter hubs, the operational range
	      of Matter is confined to the home. This limitation restricts the potential
	      for broader IoT applications and remote device management beyond the
	      immediate household environment.
	      	      	      
	\item Device Functionality Constraints
	      	      	                  
	      Matter protocol defines Matter Application Cluster Library (MACL), limiting the execution of device-specific features. As modern IoT devices and appliances increasingly offer diverse and specialized functions, the protocol's standardized approach may prevent the utilization of unique or innovative device capabilities that fall outside the predefined device types and MACL.
	      	      	      
	\item Platform Dependency
	      	      	      
	      The need for platform-specific solutions, such as Apple's `HomeKit' and `HomePod'
	      or Google's `Google Home' and `Nest Hub', results in consumers being
	      locked into particular platforms.
	      	      	      
	\item Limited End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
	      	      	      
	      The advantage of E2EE in the Matter protocol is confined to operation
	      within private networks, failing to ensure complete security throughout the
	      entire communication process.
	      	      	      
	\item Threats to User Privacy
	      	      	      
	      The communication structure that routes through cloud services potentially
	      threatens user privacy.
	      	      	      
	\item Centralized Authentication System
	      	      	      
	      Matter devices must be certified by a centralized root certificate
	      authority (CA), which makes it difficult for small development teams to participate
	      and limits consumer choices.
\end{enumerate}

These issues hinder the original purposes of the Matter protocol: interoperability,
security, and openness. Moreover, the existing centralized server-based IoT architecture
presents significant challenges for businesses.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	\item Data Reliability and Trust Issues
	      	      	      
	      The centralized server architecture creates vulnerability in data
	      integrity, making it challenging for businesses to maintain reliable records.
	      Without an immutable ledger system, businesses cannot ensure the authenticity
	      and accuracy of device interaction data, which is crucial for operation
	      analysis and service improvement.
	      	      	      
	\item Data Analysis and Tracking Problems
	      	      	      
	      Traditional centralized IoT systems lack comprehensive data tracking
	      mechanisms. This limitation makes it difficult for businesses to effectively
	      analyze device usage patterns, maintain accurate maintenance histories, and
	      extract valuable insights for business optimization. The fragmented nature
	      of data across different platforms and environments further complicates
	      the analysis process.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, we have determined that a new approach is necessary to overcome these
limitations and fully realize the potential of the Matter protocol. We propose
a solution utilizing blockchain technology to address these challenges.

\subsection{Research on related technical elements}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	\item Matter
	      	      	      
	      We use a variety of IoT devices, and several manufacturers develop and sell
	      IoT devices with different names and appearances. It is Matter that
	      enables these various smart home devices to be connected and managed at
	      once.
	      	      	      
	      Matter is an IP-based smart home interworking standard that is compatible
	      with all devices, designed to overcome the manufacturer-dependent limitations
	      of smart home devices. It was launched in 2019 by four IoT giants Apple, Amazon,
	      Google, Samsung SmartThings, and the global association CSA, formerly the Zigbee
	      Alliance, and renamed Matter in 2021.
	      	      	      
	      Matter has the following technical features:
	      	      	      
	      Unlike existing ZigBee and Z-Wave, Matter operates based on IP protocols. Since
	      Matter is based on IP, which is a network layer protocol, the communication
	      protocol below it does not matter, and eventually all processing is done
	      at the application layer. In other words, the transmission method varies
	      depending on what the application is, but as long as IP is used, the
	      method is not important. Therefore, devices with the Matter logo can work
	      together regardless of brands or supported transmission protocols. In addition,
	      the reason why it is important to use IP is that IP protocols are already
	      proven in the market in terms of interoperability and security.
	      	      	      
	      Matter is interoperable between devices. Matter allows each device to interact
	      using the same protocol, even if it is from a different manufacturer. For example,
	      Samsung Electronics' products have been linked to SmartThings, and LG
	      Electronics only to the ThinQ platform, but now Samsung Electronics'
	      products can be connected to ThinQ. Matter is a very desirable standard from
	      a user's point of view because most homes use a mixture of products from multiple
	      brands.
	      	      	      
	      Matter supports both Wi-Fi and Thread, a low-power mesh network protocol, and
	      supports various network protocols, such as using BLE in the device
	      setting process.
	      	      	      
	      In addition, Matter has the characteristics of Multi-Admin, which uses the
	      same device in conjunction with multiple platforms, AES authentication prescribed
	      by NIST in the United States regarding data encryption, and PKI and
	      certificates for device authentication.
	      	      	      
	      An open ecosystem is being created with the introduction of Matter with
	      these characteristics, and the trend of automation and intelligence of residential
	      environments is spreading through integration with Generative AI technology.
	      Korea is also promoting active efforts to build and expand a smart home
	      ecosystem by preparing support plans in line with global trends. The Korean
	      government is expanding policy support by promoting `AI@Home', a project
	      centered on Matter and Generative AI, to support the creation of a smart home
	      ecosystem.
	      	      	      
	      However, privacy protection, application of smart home technology of existing
	      houses, and high installation costs are challenges that limit the growth
	      of the market, so it is necessary to proactively prepare countermeasures.
	      	      	      
	\item Network Constraints in P2P Communication
	      	      	      
	      In a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) structure, there is minimal reliance on always-on infrastructure
	      servers. Instead, the application allows pairs of intermittently connected
	      hosts, called peers, to communicate directly with each other. Peers are
	      desktops and laptops controlled by users rather than owned by service
	      providers, and most peers are located in homes, universities, and offices.
	      Since communication occurs directly between peers without passing through
	      a specific server, this structure is referred to as Peer-to-Peer.
	      	      	      
	      Network constraints in P2P communication, particularly due to NAT (Network
	      Address Translation) and firewalls, negatively impact user experience by introducing
	      additional complexity. NAT, which is used to map private IP addresses to public
	      ones, can prevent peers behind it from being directly accessible from
	      external networks, as it often blocks incoming connections. Firewalls
	      similarly restrict inbound traffic, further complicating direct peer-to-peer
	      communication. To address these issues, NAT traversal techniques such as STUN,
	      TURN, and ICE are commonly employed. Alternatively, users may need to manually
	      configure network settings, such as port forwarding, to bypass NAT and firewall
	      restrictions, allowing for direct communication between peers. These manual
	      configurations can be challenging for users, ultimately affecting the
	      overall user experience.
	      	      	      
	\item Matter Hub
	      	      	      
	      Matter Hub is a central component of the Matter ecosystem, designed to facilitate
	      seamless communication and interoperability between smart home devices from
	      various manufacturers. Matter aims to unify different smart home
	      technologies, allowing devices to work together regardless of brand.
	      	      	      
	      Smart Home Hubs serve as central controllers for smart home devices,
	      enabling communication between Matter-compatible devices from different
	      manufacturers. Samsung SmartThings and Amazon Echo are representative examples.
	      	      	      
	      Matter Hubs connect Matter devices to the internet and other networks,
	      allowing for remote access and control. Notable examples include Google Nest
	      Hub, which integrates with Google services, and Apple HomePod, which
	      utilizes Siri for voice commands.
	      	      	      
	      While Matter Hubs play a crucial role in enhancing interoperability within
	      the smart home ecosystem, it's important to note that using Matter devices
	      typically requires a home hub. Each application may dictate the specific
	      Matter Hub that must be used, which can strictly lock users into particular
	      platforms. This limitation highlights the need for greater flexibility and
	      broader compatibility in the Matter ecosystem to ensure a truly open and
	      user-friendly IoT environment.
	      	      	      
	\item Blockchain
	      	      	      
	      To effectively integrate blockchain technology into the IoT industry, it is
	      crucial to consider blockchains with high transaction processing speeds (TPS)
	      and enterprise-friendly features.
	      	      	      
	      Several blockchain platforms stand out for their high TPS capabilities,
	      including:
	      	      	      
	      Solana: Solana is an innovative platform designed for mainstream adoption.
	      The core development team, including co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, focused
	      on scalability and efficiency based on their experience in building
	      telecommunications networks. By implementing Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof
	      of History (PoH), they achieved a throughput of up to 65,000 TPS and
	      realized very low transaction fees (\$0.00025). It's also highly energy
	      efficient, a single Solana transaction uses 0.00051 kWh.
	      	      	      
	      XRP: XRP (Ripple) uses the RPCA consensus algorithm and provides
	      approximately 1,500 TPS throughput. Specialized in international remittance,
	      it has established partnerships with many banks and financial institutions,
	      featuring fast transaction completion times of 3-5 seconds.
	      	      	      
	      Hyperledger Fabric: Hyperledger Fabric is an enterprise blockchain
	      platform that provides 2,000-20,000 TPS throughput. Through various network
	      configurations, organizations can adjust the throughput and degree of
	      centralization according to their needs. For example, by modifying
	      parameters such as the number of organizations, ordering service nodes,
	      peer nodes, and channels, administrators can find the optimal balance
	      between performance and decentralization.
	      	      	      
	      Among enterprise-friendly blockchain platforms, the following are noteworthy:
	      	      	      
	      Hyperledger Fabric: Hyperledger Fabric features a modular architecture and
	      permissioned blockchain characteristics, supporting channel-based data partitioning.
	      It has various enterprise use cases including supply chain management, asset
	      tracking, identity management, and healthcare data management.
	      	      	      
	      Quorum: Quorum, developed by JP Morgan, is an enterprise blockchain based
	      on Ethereum, featuring enhanced privacy features and high throughput. It
	      supports private transactions, voting-based consensus mechanisms, role-based
	      access control, and multi-signature contracts.
	      	      	      
	      Hyperledger Besu: Hyperledger Besu is a Java-based blockchain platform
	      compatible with Ethereum. It supports both public and private networks and
	      provides enterprise-grade governance. It is being utilized in various
	      fields including financial services, supply chain management, digital
	      asset management, and inter-enterprise collaboration platforms.
	      	      	      
	      After careful consideration of these options, Hyperledger Fabric is judged
	      as the most suitable blockchain platform for the IoT industry. It offers a
	      combination of high TPS and enterprise-grade features that are essential for
	      large-scale IoT implementations. Furthermore, Hyperledger Fabric is compatible
	      with Monachain, a blockchain platform developed by LG CNS based on
	      Hyperledger Fabric. This compatibility allows for seamless integration and
	      immediate application in existing systems, potentially accelerating
	      adoption and reducing implementation barriers.
	      	      	      
	\item Arduino
	      	      	      
	      Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use
	      hardware and software. In the context of Matter IoT, Arduino plays a
	      significant role due to its flexibility, ease of use, and strong community
	      support. When considering Arduino for Matter IoT applications, the
	      following aspects are crucial:
	      	      	      
	      Processing power: Matter protocol requires sufficient computational resources
	      to handle encryption and network communication.
	      	      	      
	      Connectivity options: Wi-Fi or Ethernet capability is essential for Matter,
	      as it's IP-based.
	      	      	      
	      Memory capacity: Adequate RAM and flash memory to run Matter stack and
	      application code.
	      	      	      
	      Power efficiency: For battery-operated IoT devices, low power consumption
	      is critical.
	      	      	      
	      Compatibility with Matter SDK: The board should be capable of running the Matter
	      SDK.
	      	      	      
	      Some Arduino boards suitable for Matter IoT projects include:
	      	      	      
	      Arduino Nano 33 IoT: This compact board features Wi-Fi connectivity and a
	      powerful SAMD21 microcontroller, making it suitable for small Matter devices.
	      	      	      
	      Arduino MKR WiFi 1010: With its low power consumption and robust Wi-Fi
	      capabilities, it's excellent for battery-operated Matter devices.
	      	      	      
	      Arduino Portenta H7: This high-performance board with dual-core processor
	      and multiple connectivity options is ideal for more complex Matter
	      applications.
	      	      	      
	      ESP32-S3: While not an official Arduino board, the ESP32-S3 is widely used
	      in the Arduino ecosystem and offers powerful processing capabilities, Wi-Fi
	      and Bluetooth connectivity, and ample memory.
	      	      	      
	      These boards offer various combinations of processing power, connectivity,
	      and memory, allowing developers to choose the most suitable option for their
	      specific Matter IoT application.
	      	      	      
	\item Web Assembly
	      	      	      
	      Web Assembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed for efficient
	      execution in web browsers. It serves as a portable target for compilation of
	      high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web
	      for client and server applications.
	      	      	      
	      Key features and benefits of Web Assembly in the context of IoT and Matter
	      include:
	      	      	      
	      Language Versatility: Web Assembly allows developers to use languages like
	      C, C++, or Rust in web environments. This is particularly beneficial for
	      IoT applications, as these languages are commonly used in embedded systems
	      development.
	      	      	      
	      Performance: Wasm provides near-native performance, making it suitable for
	      computationally intensive tasks often required in IoT applications.
	      	      	      
	      Code Reusability: It enables the use of the same codebase across different
	      platforms - from embedded devices to web interfaces. This is especially valuable
	      for functions like encryption and decryption, where consistent
	      implementation across platforms is crucial.
	      	      	      
	      Frontend Capabilities: Web Assembly empowers frontend applications to perform
	      complex operations typically associated with backend or embedded environments.
	      This can include data processing, encryption, and other intensive
	      computations directly in the browser.
	      	      	      
	      In the context of Matter Tunnel, Web Assembly can play a significant role in
	      creating consistent, high-performance interfaces for controlling and
	      managing IoT devices across different platforms. It allows developers to implement
	      complex Matter protocol operations in web applications, maintaining
	      consistency with the implementations on the devices themselves. This consistency
	      across platforms is particularly valuable for ensuring that security measures,
	      device interactions, and data handling are uniform across the entire Matter
	      ecosystem.
	      	      	      
	\item gRPC
	      	      	      
	      gRPC is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
	      framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services
	      in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing,
	      tracing, health checking and authentication.
	      	      	      
	      High Performance and Efficiency: gRPC is designed based on HTTP/2, allowing
	      it to support features like multiplexing, server push, and streaming.
	      These characteristics enable efficient management of connections between
	      multiple clients and servers, minimizing latency and optimizing bandwidth.
	      This ensures that high performance is maintained even in large-scale
	      distributed systems.
	      	      	      
	      Protocol Buffers: gRPC uses Protocol Buffers for service definition.
	      Protocol Buffers is a powerful binary serialization tool developed by
	      Google, allowing the definition of data structures and their conversion into
	      various programming languages. This increases the efficiency of data
	      transmission and maintains consistency in APIs.
	      	      	      
	      Easy Installation and Scalability: gRPC offers simple installation,
	      allowing developers to set up runtime and development environments with
	      just a single command. It also provides scalability that can handle millions
	      of RPCs per second, making it suitable for large-scale applications. This allows
	      developers to quickly build and operate services without complex infrastructure
	      setups.
	      	      	      
	      Cross-Language and Platform Support: gRPC works across multiple
	      programming languages and platforms. It can automatically generate idiomatic
	      client and server stubs for various languages such as Java, C++, Python,
	      Go, and Ruby. This facilitates collaboration between teams using different
	      tech stacks and enhances code reusability.
	      	      	      
	      Bi-Directional Streaming: gRPC supports bi-directional streaming between clients
	      and servers. This allows clients to send data to the server while
	      simultaneously receiving streamed data from the server. This feature is particularly
	      useful in applications that require real-time data transmission.
	      	      	      
	      Integrated Authentication and Security: gRPC enhances security by
	      integrating full pluggable authentication features at the HTTP/2 transport
	      layer. This simplifies the implementation of user authentication and authorization,
	      ensuring safe transmission of sensitive data.
	      	      	      
	      Due to these features, gRPC is widely used in various fields, including
	      microservices architecture, IoT applications, and mobile backend services.
	      By using gRPC, developers can build efficient and scalable systems, making
	      it easier to manage communication between services.

	\item Benefits of Blockchain for Data Mining
	      	      	      
	      The integration of blockchain technology and data mining techniques for anomaly detection provides efficient methods through their combined application. Data stored on the blockchain can be treated as big data, and data mining techniques enable the extraction of hidden patterns and insights.
	      	      	      
	      This paper explores analytical approaches to blockchain data and practical applications, demonstrating how these technologies enhance anomaly detection and fraud prevention. Blockchain's transparent recording system facilitates data tracking and monitoring. It serves as an effective tool for corporate data analysis, with a key advantage being rapid detection of operational changes or fraudulent activities.
	      	      	      
	      Key applications from the literature include:
	      	      	      
	      \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	      	\item Analysis of Bitcoin Transaction Networks
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Zola et al. (2019) analyzed changes in Bitcoin transaction patterns by utilizing the time-series data of the blockchain. They used data from WalletExplorer and the Bitcoin mainnet over the past three years, calculating F1 scores through k-fold cross-testing. By analyzing the transaction data linked in chronological order on the blockchain, it is possible to detect cybersecurity threats and identify changes in behavioral patterns.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Blockchain Data Collection and Analysis
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Brinckman et al. (2019) presented techniques for crawling, collecting, and analyzing blockchain data. They demonstrated a method for clustering transactions and extracting account characteristics to identify fraudulent accounts, which serves as a good example of understanding the data structure of the blockchain and effectively analyzing it.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Time-Series Transaction Data Analysis
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Zhao et al. (2021) analyzed the entire dataset of the Ethereum blockchain from a temporal perspective. They utilized the ethereum blockchain dataset from the Bigquery Public Data Repository to examine changes in transaction patterns over time, comparing the accuracy of Random Forest and Logistic Regression, and visualizing the temporal evaluation of the collected data.
	      \end{enumerate}
	      	      	      
	      These application examples demonstrate that effective analysis is possible by leveraging the connected data structure and temporal characteristics of the blockchain. In particular, the data structure of the blockchain can be effectively utilized to identify patterns in sensitive transaction data and detect anomalous behaviors, which can be considered a significant advantage of blockchain-based data analysis.
	      	      	      
	\item Benefits of Blockchain for Data Integrity and Accessibility
	      	      	      
	      Blockchain technology has emerged as an innovative solution in healthcare data management, addressing important challenges in data security, integrity, and interoperability. Here are three representative implementations that demonstrate the applications of blockchain in healthcare:
	      	      	      
	      \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	      	\item MedRec
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      MedRec is a blockchain project in healthcare that enables comprehensive management of medical data, including data provision by medical institutions, patient licensing, and data utilization by research institutes. MedRec 2.0 is implemented using Go-ethereum and Solidity languages, utilizing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for intermediary-free data exchange. Like other blockchains, MedRec ensures security through its blockchain nature. Due to decentralization, data is maintained across all network nodes and stored in nodes of patients and their service providers. The blockchain's consensus mechanism prevents security issues from single-point vulnerabilities. Additionally, if one node attempts to modify a specific transaction in a block, that modified node becomes inconsistent with others and is excluded from consensus, maintaining record integrity.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Estonian e-Health
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      The Estonian e-Health Foundation and Guardtime have strengthened security and patient monitoring by implementing KSI blockchain technology. The healthcare system integrates medical service data through X-Road, a data exchange platform, enabling comprehensive medical service data analysis. This system provides personal healthcare data integrity verification, with healthcare providers transmitting data integrity to the KSI server for permanent blockchain and offline recording. Through the ``e-prescription service", doctors and pharmacies can verify prescription integrity. Additionally, the ``electronic health registration service" allows doctors to access medical images like X-rays using only the patient's ID code. These systems enable secure storage, efficient sharing, and integrity verification of medical data.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Mediblock
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Mediblock is a blockchain-based integrated management platform for personal medical data that aims to integrate distributed patient medical data. Mediblock secures data by granting patients access to medical data and allowing only them to decrypt the entire data, while recording data hash values on the blockchain for integrity. It improves data reliability by restricting medical record creation to certified medical personnel, and ensures transparency by recording data access information and rights on the blockchain. Additionally, it enables safe data sharing through relay services and secondary backup storage, while facilitating secure data transactions through an encrypted data trading market within the platform.
	      \end{enumerate}
	      	      	      
	      These implementations demonstrate how blockchain technology enhances healthcare data management through improved integrity, security, accessibility, and transparency. These advantages can be applied to blockchain-based Matter tunnels, potentially replacing Matter hubs to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the Matter protocol.
	      	      	      
	\item Hyperledger Fabric Performance
	      	      	      
	      The performance of Hyperledger Fabric is often questioned, particularly regarding
	      transaction processing speeds (TPS) in comparison to other blockchain platforms.
	      The performance of a Fabric network is complex due to the involvement of
	      multiple organizations with varying hardware and networking
	      infrastructures, as well as factors such as the number of channels and chaincode
	      implementation.
	      	      	      
	      Hyperledger Fabric 2.x has introduced performance improvements over
	      version1.4, which is no longer in long-term support (LTS). Fabric 2.5 is the
	      latest LTS version and includes a new peer gateway service. This service, along
	      with the new gateway SDK, is expected to enhance the performance of
	      applications.
	      	      	      
	      \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	      	\item Hardware and Topology
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      In Hyperledger Fabric, the topology used consists of two peer organizations
	      	      (PeerOrg0 and PeerOrg1), each with one peer node, along with a single ordering
	      	      service organization (OrdererOrg0) that utilizes Raft consensus with one
	      	      ordering service node. TLS is enabled on each node.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      All nodes utilized the same hardware configuration:
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      - Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4210 CPU @ 2.20GHz
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      - 40 Cores made up of 2 CPUs. Each CPU has 10 physical cores supporting
	      	      20 Threads in total
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      - 64Gb Samsung 2933Mhx Memory
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      - MegaRAID Tri-Mode SAS3516 (MR9461-16i) disk controller
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      - Intel 730 and DC S35x0/3610/3700 Series SSD attached to disk
	      	      controller
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      - Ethernet Controller X710/X557-AT 10GBASE-T
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      - Ubuntu 20.04
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      All machines were connected to the same switch. Hyperledger Fabric was
	      	      deployed natively across three physical machines, meaning that the native
	      	      binaries were installed and executed without using container technologies
	      	      such as Docker or Kubernetes.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Hyperledger Fabric Application Configuration
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      State Database: LevelDB was used as the state database.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Gateway Service: The concurrency limit was set to 20,000.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Application Channel: A single application channel was created with two
	      	      peers and an orderer, configured to use V1\_4 capabilities for lifecycle
	      	      deployment while other capabilities were set to V2\_0.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Configuration: Only the application channel existed, no private data
	      	      was used, and default policies applied. No range or JSON queries were
	      	      conducted, and the network was TLS-enabled without mutual TLS.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Chaincode: Go chaincode (fixed-asset-base) was deployed without the
	      	      Contract API, and an endorsement policy of “1 Of Any” was specified.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Load Generator
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Hyperledger Caliper 0.5.0 served as both the load generator and for generating
	      	      report outputs. It was configured to work with Fabric 2.4, utilizing the
	      	      peer Gateway Service to initiate and assess transactions, with all
	      	      transactions originating from a single organization directed to its
	      	      gateway peer. The load was defined based on the fixed-asset benchmark from
	      	      Hyperledger Caliper-Benchmarks.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Four bare-metal machines were employed to host remote Caliper workers and
	      	      a single Caliper manager, which was responsible for generating the
	      	      load on the Hyperledger Fabric network. To create sufficient workload on
	      	      the Fabric network, multiple Caliper workers were necessary, corresponding
	      	      to the number of clients currently connected to the network. The
	      	      results section includes details on the number of Caliper workers
	      	      utilized.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Key Points
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      The results presented here were generated using the latest builds of
	      	      Hyperledger Fabric 2.5, employing the default node and channel configuration
	      	      values. The block cutting parameters used were as follows:
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      \textit{Block Cut Time: 2 seconds}
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      \textit{Block Size: 500}
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      \textit{Preferred Maximum Bytes: 2 MB}
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      To avoid hitting concurrency limits while pushing enough workload
	      	      through, the gateway concurrency limit was set to 20,000.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Only a single channel was utilized, meaning the peer did not leverage its
	      	      full resource potential.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      The chaincode was optimized for these tests, and real-world chaincode
	      	      is expected to perform less efficiently.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      The Caliper workload generator was also optimized for transaction
	      	      throughput, whereas real-world applications would involve client implementations
	      	      that may introduce latency.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Transactions were sent to a single gateway peer from the same organization;
	      	      real-world scenarios would likely involve multiple organizations
	      	      sending transactions concurrently, potentially leading to higher TPS results.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      Using the gateway service allowed for better performance as blocks were
	      	      not received via the delivery service to confirm transaction completion,
	      	      enhancing both client and network performance compared to the legacy
	      	      node SDK.

\subsection{Cost Estimation}

Although it is different from the actual application in the industry, we
envision a test network operating two Hyperledger Fabric peers and four orderers
on a single computer. For this configuration, we plan to use an AWS EC2 t2.medium
instance (2vCPU, 4GB RAM). This t2.medium instance is deemed suitable for a
test network of this scale, as it meets the minimum specifications required for
running peers and orderer while providing a cost-effective option for development
and testing purposes. According to the AWS pricing calculator, operating a t2.medium
instance in the Seoul region with a long-term commitment would cost approximately
\$18.47 per month. Adding the cost of a required 50GB EBS volume at approximately
\$4.56, the total estimated monthly cost would be \$23.03. This represents the
minimum cost for establishing a test environment, and an actual production
environment would likely require higher-specification instances and additional
infrastructure configuration. However, if we can utilize the company's
existing underutilized server resources, we expect to significantly reduce these
cloud cost.

\subsection{Software in use}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	\item ADEPT
	      	      	      
	      ADEPT, which stands for Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry,
	      is a blockchain platform designed for IoT devices that operates on a peer-to-peer
	      basis. The idea behind ADEPT was introduced in 2015 as a result of collaboration
	      between Samsung and IBM. It incorporates technologies like BitTorrent, Telehash,
	      and Ethereum. ADEPT organizes IoT devices based on their capacities,
	      allowing them to independently manage, analyze, and share their data. This
	      platform is being implemented in wearable technology and household appliances.
	      For instance, Samsung's smart washing machine employs ADEPT technology to automatically
	      order essential supplies, such as detergent, when they are running low.
	      	      	      
	\item IoT Chain

	      System). Its primary goal is to improve security within the IoT ecosystem
	      while utilizing ICT (IoT Chain Token) for accessing IoT products. By leveraging
	      the decentralized security of conventional blockchains, IoT Chain
	      overcomes challenges related to transaction speed and scalability through
	      PBFT and DAG. The architecture consists of a main chain and a side chain;
	      the side chain executes smart contracts using coins generated from the
	      main chain. The main chain employs PBFT for rapid transaction validation,
	      while the side chain utilizes DAG for efficient transaction processing. SPV
	      allows payment verification by checking only the headers of blocks, rather
	      than all their components, which reduces verification fees and decreases user
	      overhead. IoT Chain finds applications in shared economies and smart home
	      technologies. In November 2018, initiatives were launched to create a
	      developer ecosystem, with plans to publicly release IoT Chain in December.

\section{Specifications}

\subsection{Core Requirements Specifications}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	\item Hub Elimination and Range Extension
	      	      
	      \begin{figure} [h!]
	      	\centering
	      	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{blockchain_queue.png}
	      	\caption{Blockchain Queue}
	      	\label{fig:blockchain_queue}
	      \end{figure}
	      	      	      
	      To eliminate the mandatory use of Matter Hubs and extend operational range,
	      we propose replacing traditional Matter hubs and cloud services with Hyperledger          Fabric's chaincode functionality. This transformation fundamentally changes how Matter
	      devices communicate and operate, freeing them from the physical constraints
	      of home networks.
	      	      	      
	      The core of this solution lies in implementing a message queue system within
	      the blockchain. Instead of relying on a physical hub for communication, each
	      Matter device interacts with a dedicated queue in the blockchain. This
	      queue serves as a virtual communication channel, enabling devices to operate
	      beyond the traditional home network boundaries.
	      	      	      
	      \begin{figure}[h!]
	      	\centering
	      	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{KeyValueBasedBlockchainQueue.png}
	      	\caption{Key\-Value based Blockchain Queue}
	      	\label{fig:KeyValueBasedBlockchainQueue}
	      \end{figure}
	      	      	      
	      However, implementing a traditional queue structure in Hyperledger Fabric
	      would be inefficient due to the complexity of transaction operations. Reading
	      and writing to an array-based queue would require reading the entire array
	      for each push operation, creating unnecessary overhead. To optimize this process,
	      we propose using a Key-Value Store structure where the key is formatted as
	      \emph{devicePK-index} (device public key combined with a index) and
	      the value contains the message payload.
	      	      	      
	      This architecture provides several advantages:
	      \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	      	\item Eliminates the need for physical Matter hubs by virtualizing their
	      	      functionality through blockchain
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Enables device operation from any location with internet connectivity
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Maintains secure and reliable communication through blockchain's inherent
	      	      security features
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Optimizes performance through efficient key-value based message handling
	      \end{enumerate}
	      	      	      
	\item Protocol Flexibility and QR Code Innovation
	      	      	      
	      To support diverse device functionalities and provide greater flexibility, we innovate the protocol and QR code structure. Instead of relying on predefined application clusters in Matter protocol, our solution implements function definitions within QR codes, enabling dynamic functionality support.
	      	      	      
	      \begin{figure}[h!]
	      	\centering
	      	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{MatterTunnelQRCode.png}
	      	\caption{Matter Tunnel QR Code}
	      	\label{fig:MatterTunnelQRCode}
	      \end{figure}
	      	      	      
	      The QR code structure consists of three main components: a 33-byte public key (PK), a 16-byte passcode, and function definitions. Each function definition comprises an 18-byte function name and 2 bytes representing parameter and return value types. Matter Tunnel supports four basic types - void, string, number, and boolean - each represented by 2 bits. This efficient encoding allows for up to seven parameters and one return value within the 2-byte type definition.
	      	      	      
	      \begin{figure}[h!]
	      	\centering
	      	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{MatterTunnelTX.png}
	      	\caption{Matter Tunnel TX Format}
	      	\label{fig:MatterTunnelTXFormat}
	      \end{figure}
	      	      	      
	      The Matter Tunnel transaction format similarly reflects this flexibility, consisting of a 64-byte signature, 18-byte function name, 33-byte public key, 8-byte timestamp, and encrypted arguments. By including function names directly in the transaction format rather than using opcodes, the solution simplifies data analysis while maintaining extensibility. This approach effectively eliminates the constraints of Matter's predefined device types, allowing manufacturers to implement custom functionalities while ensuring seamless integration with the Matter ecosystem.
	      	      	                  
	\item Data Analytics and System Reliability
	      	      	      
        Our AI Dashboard revolutionizes how organizations interact with blockchain data by making complex data analysis accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background. At its core, the system transforms everyday language questions into precise blockchain queries, allowing business managers, analysts, and decision-makers to extract valuable insights without writing a single line of code.
        	                
        For example, a business manager can simply ask "Show transactions from \{src\_pk\} to \{pk\}" and the system automatically converts this natural language question into appropriate technical queries, handling all the complex filtering and data retrieval operations behind the scenes. This breakthrough eliminates the traditional requirement for programming expertise or specialized blockchain knowledge, democratizing access to critical data.
        	      
        The system achieves this through a sophisticated AI model trained on a comprehensive dataset of 10,000 carefully crafted examples of natural language questions and their corresponding technical queries. To ensure robust understanding of query variations, we implemented advanced data augmentation techniques using BERT-based contextual substitution and random word swapping, expanding our training data to over 3,000 examples while preserving semantic integrity. This approach helps the AI recognize different phrasings of the same question and maintain consistent query translation.
        	      
        This direct interaction approach revolutionizes data analytics by eliminating multiple intermediaries present in traditional systems. Conventional approaches require data analysts to process raw data and relay servers to transmit processed information, creating multiple points where data could be corrupted or manipulated by malicious actors. Each intermediary step not only introduces potential security vulnerabilities but also raises questions about data authenticity.
        	      
        By connecting directly to the blockchain through secure gRPC connections, our AI Dashboard completely eliminates these risks. Instead of trusting multiple intermediaries, users receive data straight from the blockchain itself, ensuring complete data authenticity. The system combines this direct access with natural language processing, allowing decision-makers to query blockchain data through simple conversations while maintaining the highest level of data integrity. Whether you're requesting transaction histories, analyzing device patterns, or monitoring system status, you can trust that the data you're viewing is exactly what's recorded on the blockchain - unaltered and authentic.
	      
	      	      	      
	\item Decentralization
	      	      	      
	      Our approach to decentralization fundamentally reimagines the Matter
	      protocol's architecture while maintaining its core benefits. Unlike the traditional
	      Matter protocol that relies on a centralized Certificate Authority (CA) for
	      device certification, Matter Tunnel eliminates this requirement while
	      preserving protocol compatibility. By removing the centralized authentication
	      system, we lower barriers to entry for device manufacturers and smaller
	      development teams, fostering innovation and competition in the IoT ecosystem.
	      	      	      
	      This decentralized approach maintains the Matter protocol's ability to control
	      multiple vendors' devices through a single application, ensuring that the key
	      benefit of interoperability remains intact. The elimination of platform
	      dependencies further enhances true decentralization, freeing users from vendor
	      lock-in and creating a more open IoT environment.

	      Our solution significantly enhances End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) and user
	      privacy protection by fundamentally restructuring the communication
	      architecture of Matter devices. Traditional Matter implementations rely on
	      a cloud-based communication model where applications communicate with cloud
	      services, and Matter hubs poll these services for updates. This structure inherently
	      compromises both E2EE and privacy. Matter Tunnel addresses these
	      limitations through a blockchain-based approach.
	      	      	      
	      Key Security and Privacy Enhancements:
	      	      	      
	      \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2ex, parsep=1ex]
	      	\item Direct Blockchain Communication
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      By eliminating cloud service intermediaries, this system enables direct
	      	      and encrypted communication between applications and devices. The
	      	      removal of vulnerable points in the communication chain enhances
	      	      security, while ensuring true end-to-end encryption throughout the entire
	      	      process.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Enhanced Privacy Protection
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	      This system maintains privacy by only exposing device public keys on
	      	      the blockchain, while keeping sensitive information like IP addresses and
	      	      location data completely private. This approach enables anonymous
	      	      device operation, significantly reducing the attack surface for potential
	      	      privacy breaches.
	      	      	      	      	      	      
	      	\item Secure Device Registration and Authentication
	      	      	      	      	      	                      
	      	      The system implements a robust security mechanism through a predefined `register' 
	      	      function on the blockchain where users must verify device ownership by providing 
	      	      the correct 128-bit passcode. This establishes a secure transaction relationship 
	      	      between the user and device. With the passcode's substantial bit length, the 
	      	      probability of an adversary successfully guessing it is negligible 
	      	      $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{128}$, effectively preventing unauthorized access at the fundamental level. 
	      	      This approach creates an inherently secure system that prevents attacks 
	      	      by design rather than through reactive measures.
	      \end{enumerate}
	      	      	      
	      By leveraging blockchain technology and existing Matter security features,
	      our solution creates a more robust and private IoT ecosystem. The combination
	      of anonymous operation, secure message counting, and direct blockchain communication
	      ensures that both E2EE and user privacy are maintained at the highest possible
	      level.
	      	      	      
	\item Real-Time Performance with Hyperledger Fabric
	      	      	      
	      To ensure real-time performance in Matter Tunnel, we carefully selected Hyperledger
	      Fabric as our blockchain platform after extensive evaluation of various options.
	      This choice was driven by Hyperledger Fabric's unique characteristics that
	      align with the real-time requirements of IoT device communication.
	      	      	      
	      Hyperledger Fabric's high transaction processing capability stands out as
	      a crucial feature for our implementation, supporting 2,000-20,000 transactions
	      per second (TPS). This throughput is achieved through multiple channels
	      that enable parallel transaction processing, effectively handling concurrent
	      device communications while providing near-instantaneous transaction finality.
	      The platform's configurable architecture can enhance performance by
	      allowing optimization of network parameters, enabling adjustment of block creation
	      time, supporting custom channel configurations for different device groups,
	      and permitting fine-tuning of consensus mechanisms to match specific use case
	      requirements.
	      	      	      
	      By leveraging Hyperledger Fabric's comprehensive capabilities, Matter
	      Tunnel achieves the real-time performance necessary for effective IoT
	      device control and monitoring. The platform's ability to handle high transaction
	      volumes while maintaining low latency ensures that device interactions remain
	      responsive and reliable, meeting the demanding requirements of modern IoT
	      applications.

\section{Discussion}
    
\subsection{Technical Difficulties}

During the development of Matter Tunnel, we encountered several technical hurdles that needed to be addressed. In our initial approach, we attempted to build WebAssembly from C++ code. While we successfully built simple C++ code to WebAssembly, we faced significant challenges when trying to link OpenSSL. Although we managed to build the required libraries as WebAssembly static libraries, the linking process produced various errors. Despite consulting numerous resources including Stack Overflow, we couldn't find a working solution. Due to time constraints, we ultimately decided to abandon the WebAssembly approach and instead implement native code for each platform (C++ and JavaScript).

Working with byte and bit operations across different platforms proved challenging, particularly in ensuring JavaScript code matched C++ functionality exactly. We encountered numerous encoding issues, which we resolved by either converting problematic sections to base16 within functions or utilizing Latin-1 encoding where appropriate.

The AI component also presented technical challenges, particularly due to computational resource limitations. Using Google Colab's GPU restrictions meant we had limited processing power and time for model training. This constraint affected our ability to implement extensive data augmentation techniques and train our models on diverse patterns. While we developed a synthetic data generation pipeline for natural language query processing, the GPU limitations prevented us from exploring more sophisticated augmentation methods that could have improved our model's robustness. Despite these constraints, we implemented an iterative training approach and efficient caching mechanisms to optimize our model's performance within the available resources.

\subsection{Non-technical Difficulties}

The most significant non-technical challenge was coordinating between different team members working on various components of the system. Each developers had different perspectives and priorities, which sometimes led to integration challenges and communication barriers. To address these challenges, we implemented regular meetings, and the increased frequency of communication proved highly effective, as it allowed team members to better understand each other’s constraints and requirements.

Through consistent effort to maintain open communication, we were able to transform our initial challenges into opportunities for team growth and project improvement. The solutions we implemented not only resolved our immediate challenges but also established a strong foundation for future development. As a result, we successfully delivered Matter Tunnel with improved team dynamics and a more cohesive development process than when we started.


\subsection{Conclusion}

Matter Tunnel successfully demonstrated the feasibility of enabling communication between IoT devices and users without requiring additional hardware like Matter hubs. This breakthrough not only freed devices from spatial constraints but also expanded the range of supported functionalities beyond Matter's predefined application cluster specification. The implementation significantly enhanced security and privacy through blockchain-based end-to-end encryption and decentralization. From an enterprise perspective, the system substantially improved reliability by providing immutable transaction records and comprehensive data analytics capabilities, enabling more informed decision-making through transparent and trustworthy operational insights.

Looking ahead, Matter Tunnel shows great promise in revolutionizing the IoT industry by providing a more open, secure, and flexible device management solution. Future development will focus on successfully implementing WebAssembly builds to enhance cross-platform compatibility and expanding platform support to accommodate a wider range of devices and use cases. Additionally, we aim to improve the dashboard's AI capabilities by incorporating advanced data augmentation techniques such as back translation, which will enhance the natural language processing system's performance and versatility in handling various query patterns.
